# hello-world
A program written in Java that serves as my introduction to the basics of github. This README serves as a temple for 
future READMEs that I will write so it'll be redundant in certain areas

## Synopsis
This project is made so that I have an understanding of the basics of github before uploading bigger projects.

## Code Example
After compiling the project, it simply prints "Hello World" to the standard output

## Motivation
I wrote this program so that I wouldn't screw up any larger, more important projects

## Installation
*Zip File Installation
>On the github page for [this project](https://github.com/TRDan6577/hello-world), there is a link to download as a zip
file. Download it and extract it. Then in the command line, navigate to the src folder in hello-world. Then compile
and run the HelloWorld.java program.

*Installation Using Git's Clone Feature
>Use the URL [https://github.com/TRDan6577/hello-world.git](https://github.com/TRDan6577/hello-world.git)
along with the clone command in the command line. Then, navigate to the src folder in hello-world. Then compile and run
the HelloWorld.java program.

## API Reference
No commands are used in the program, therefore, this section is unnecessary
 
## Tests
It just prints "Hello World!" so again, this part is unnecessary
